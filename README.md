# The 4th team project. 1.Data-Analysis-Car-Purchase
## Objective/Goal
1. Identify the trends between dependent and independent variables.

2. Correlation between independent variables and dependent variable.

3. Prediction of a purchase amount based on the Machine Learning Algorithms

Build a model which will make a estimate a car purchase amount. To achieve this objective we wanted to do an Exploratory Data Analysis on our dataset to understand the relationship between study variables and how they can predict the car purchase amount. 

## Role
We worked independently for 1 month for our 4th team project to extract, clean, analyze, visualize, create model with Regressor and fit the models.

## Data
Our data contains 500 unique values and 9 features. 
The data set has the following columns: 
 0   Customer Name        
 1   Customer e-mail      
 2   Country             
 3   Gender              
 4   Age                 
 5   Annual Salary       
 6   Credit Card Debt    
 7   Net Worth           
 8   Car Purchase Amount  

## Tools Used
SimpleImputer, KNNImputer, KBinsDiscretizer, SklearnTransformerWrapper
ColumnTransformer, Pipeline,  StandardScaler, keras

## Models Used
We trained eight models, one RandomForestRegressor, one KNeighborsRegressor, one LinearRegression, one SVR, one XGBRegressor, one AdaBoostRegressor, one GradientBoostingRegressor and one DecisionTreeRegressor. We also implied Pipeline and used Grid Search to find the best hyperparameters and evaluated results with the following regression metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error and  r2 score.

## Results
Among ML models that we have built for this study SVR and LinearRegression showed the most stable and accurate results in both trained and test versions whereas RandomForestRegressor performed the worst among other ML models.

We were somewhat successful in giving a general idea but because of limitations of time and data set we still have a long way to go. Looking forward, we would like to acquire more data for accurate prediction of price so that if someone wants to buy a used car they have an idea of what it would cost them beforehand and not end up paying more than the carâ€™s worth.
